    E --> K[Skill Token Allocation]
    E --> L[Contribution Tracking]
    
    F --> M[Network Connections]
    F --> N[Professional Interactions]
```

### Core Components:

1. **Professional Profile Management**
   - Blockchain-verified resume creation
   - Skill declaration and tracking
   - Credential verification

2. **Skill Endorsement System**
   - Peer and expert skill verification
   - Decentralized reputation scoring
   - Transparent endorsement mechanism

   - Professional network incentivization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Clarity CLI
- Stacks wallet
- Minimum skill verification stake

### Basic Usage

1. **Create Professional Profile**

(contract-call? .resume-pool create-profile 
    "Jane Doe" 
    "Software Engineer" 
    u1000)
```

2. **Endorse a Skill**
```clarity
(contract-call? .resume-pool endorse-skill 
    profile-id
    "Blockchain Development"
    u5)
```

3. **Verify Credentials**
```clarity
(contract-call? .resume-pool verify-credential
    profile-id
    "University Degree"
    "MIT Computer Science")
```
